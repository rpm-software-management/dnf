	   http://people.redhat.com/lmacken/insertmd.py

2006-06-13 14:00  katzj

	* yum/misc.py: fix syntax error

2006-06-13 12:03  katzj

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: uniqify the file list.  this avoids the fact
	that with the C-parser and the filesystem package, the list of
	files ends up with / at the end and so we end up with double
	entries.  since we can't have duplicate filenames in a directory
	anyway, unique fixes

2006-06-12 23:46  skvidal

	* yum/packageSack.py: 
	make global excludes work again - packgeSack.MetaSack.delPackage
	needs to be able to delete the pkg object asked for in each/every
	sack or global excludes fail to do anything
	
	jeremy told me I had to mention that this is all jbowes' fault when
	I fixed it. :)

2006-06-12 23:03  lmacken

2006-06-09 17:17  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/repoMDObject.py: apply lewk's patch to fix jeremy's
	lambda (iiiiiiiiiick) make corrupt repomd.xml's do the right thing
	in the new celementree repomd.xml parser

2006-06-06 23:40  katzj

	* cli.py: and actually save with the comment explaining this...

2006-06-06 23:31  katzj

	* yum-updatesd.py: lots of work to get this to do more of what's
	needed for puplet.  high-level summary: * add support for automatic
	downloading of updates when available * add support for automatic
	installation of updates when available * make emitters more
	object-y so that we can emit more types of signals more   easily. 
	dbus is probably the most fleshed out right now * threads for
	updates/downloading so that we can continue to interact   with the
	daemon while these occur * little bit more command-line fun for
	ease-of-debugging

2006-06-06 23:27  katzj

	* cli.py: use generic getKeyForPackage

2006-06-06 23:26  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: move gpg key fetching code into core library;
	use a callback function so that we can determine whether or not to
	import if user interaction is needed cleanly between, eg, yum tui
	and pirut

2006-06-05 23:53  katzj

	* yum/yumRepo.py: fix getting group data

2006-06-05 23:18  katzj

	* docs/Makefile: likewise

2006-06-05 23:18  katzj

	* Makefile: no more yum-arch

2006-06-04 15:56  mjs

	* yum/plugins.py: Fixed missing comma

2006-06-04 15:48  mjs

	* cli.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/config.py, yum/plugins.py: Allow
	plugins to add and manipulate Yum's configuration file options in
	the same way as they are defined in Yum. This means that plugin
	option defines are far more flexible and powerful than before. The
	old API (registerOpt) still exists but is deprecated (with a saner
	implementation). I will update the wiki with info on how plugins
	can now define their own options.
	
	This cleans up a lot of plugin related code but changes the Yum API
	slightly wrt to initialisation. Documentation about this to come on
	yum-devel.
	
	This commit also includes Misa's (misa+yum@redhat.com) patch to add
	a config option for specifying the directories to look in for
	plugin configuration files.

2006-05-30 06:15  tambet

	* yum/: __init__.py, packages.py, storagefactory.py, yumRepo.py:
	2006-05-30  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>
	
		* yum/storagefactory.py: Implement. The yumRepo class got a
	little
		crowded with all of these "try to import _sqlitecache,
	sqlite, etc...".
	
		* yum/yumRepo.py (YumPackageSack.populate): Use
	repo.storage to
		get cache handler.
		(YumRepository.__init__): Use storagefactory to get package
	sack.
	
		* yum/packages.py (RpmBase.inPrcoRange): Fix the leftover
		mdUtils.compareEVR usage.
	
		* yum/__init__.py (YumBase.__init__): Log the used storage
	name.

2006-05-28 08:12  skvidal

	remove some unused imports

2006-05-24 14:41  pnasrat

	* yum/: repos.py, yumRepo.py: Enable failure_callbacks on mirror
	objects

2006-05-24 10:37  katzj

	* yum/__init__.py: keeping around older Extras packages, we can end
	up with some pretty pathological multilib cases around noarch
	packages.
	
	Having both x86_64 and noarch of the same package installed is
	non-sensical.  But we want to allow switching from native -> noarch
	and back.  So, let's take into account that noarch is a third case
	beyond base arch and compat arch.
	
	With that, we get to where there are four basic cases of newest
	packages 1) No noarch packages.  This ends up with what we have
	today where you install the base arch and the compat arch if
	available 2) Only noarch packages.  This also ends up like present
	3) Noarch package that's newer than the basearch package.  This
	means that we want the noarch package and not the basearch or
	compat-arch 4) Noarch package that's older than the basearch
	package.  This means we want the basearch and compat-arch if it
	exists
	
	rh #189998

2006-05-24 10:15  tambet

	* yum/storagefactory.py: file storagefactory.py was initially added

2006-05-19 18:15  katzj

	* yum-updatesd.py: okay, every 10 seconds is a little bit often...
	:-)

2006-05-19 17:39  katzj

	* yum-updatesd.py, etc/yum-updatesd.conf: a variety of things as I
	start to hook up proto-puplet * some consistency fixes to make
	service names all edu.duke.linux.yum, object paths differ between
	the signaller and the listener but that makes sense * add a
	--no-fork mode so that you can use ctrl-c and hack on this more
	easily * add a ShutDown method (disabled by default) since I was
	getting hit by	 the sigint catcher a few times * add a
	GetUpdatesInfo method to return the information on the available  
	updates.  this should probably be changed to return the information
	in   an async fashion, but I'll get there

2006-05-11 17:06  mjs

	* yum/plugins.py: Committed Michael Chapman's patch for bug #596.
	Plugin defined repository options weren't being read from the

	dtrt  - exports a dbus system bus method to allow for triggering to
	check for    updates - uses name = edu.duke.linux.yum.Updatesd,
	object=/Updatesd,  with the method "CheckNow"  - emits a dbus
	system bus signal if updates are available: membername is
	UpdatesAvailableSignal - the string tells how many are available.  
	- emits a dbus system bus signal if updates are NOT available
	membername  is: NoUpdatesAvailableSignal

	list epoch if it exists in yum info - bug 576

2006-03-25 23:51  mjs

	* yum/config.py: - Defaults are now copied at BaseConfig
	instantation time so that they can be	safely changed at runtime
	in multithreaded situations - It is now ok to read and write
	from/to options before populate() has been   called. This avoids
	the AttributeError that occurred previously.

2006-03-02 16:20  skvidal

	* yum/pgpmsg.py: 
	reverse the sort order of the displayed user id from gpg keys. 
	This is more likely to get us the most recent and hopefully most

	fix for yum provides foocommand not working
	
	this, ultimately, means that yum provides *foocommand* will be VERY
	SLOW for dumb reasons.
	
	there needs to be a better solution than this but at least this
	solution is functionally correct, albeit slow

2006-02-27 19:29  katzj

	* cli.py, yum/__init__.py: 
	- remove useless log output - make 'yum search' use
	searchGenerator()

2006-02-22 01:30  skvidal

	* yum/__init__.py: 
	first stab at making the search function a generator.  In order to
	maintain API I made a searchGenerator() method which is used by
	searchPackages to get the same result. searchGenerator should be
	much lighter on memory for big searches and give you more immediate
	results.  Additionally, you don't need the search callback as
	results are yielded immediately upon finding them.
	
	need to port searchPackageProvides() to use a generator as well.

2006-02-05 17:03  mjs

	* yum/plugins.py: Applied Paul Nasrat's patch to make plugins group
	aware with some changes.  Since group information is only available
	after repos have been set up, RepoSetupPluginConduit has been split
	into PreRepoSetupPluginConduit and PostRepoSetupPluginConduit with
	getGroups() available in the latter.

	longer need to be defined twice) - lots of documentation - handle

	- warn when getConfigOption and setConfigOption are used

2006-01-17 02:40  skvidal

	* yum/__init__.py:

	anything in pup or pirut

2006-01-12 01:03  skvidal

	* yum/: __init__.py, depsolve.py, sqlitesack.py:

	* yum/depsolve.py: make Depsolve an object

2006-01-04 20:30  katzj

	available in both

2005-12-22 11:07  skvidal

	fix for rh bug: 175505 needed installroot and distroverpkg options

	* yum/packages.py: fix KeyError when no base in location

2005-12-15 13:50  katzj

	* yum/config.py: inherit the repo being enabled from the base
	config per seth's request :)

2005-12-14 16:17  katzj

	* yum/: config.py, repos.py: better fix for the mirror problem. 
	ensure we set the value if it doesn't exist in the repo object. 
	also, default enabled/groupsenabled to 0 in the repo since we'll
	override if the config says one.
	
	RepoConf and Repository really do need to be merged...

2005-12-14 14:12  katzj

	object once and allow it to be either installed or from the sacks. 
	tested with a) yum update libgcj on a system where updating gcj
	would break deps b) yum update gnome-vfs2 where there are things
	depending on gnome-vfs2 c) yum remove gnome-vfs2
	
	The only case I didn't check was the obsoletes case, but it looks
	like the right thing should happen

2005-12-13 22:55  katzj

	* yum/depsolve.py: fix traceback with an installed package
	requiring something that's no longer in any repos (#175647)

	- make shell not traceback when user doesn't close a quoted string

2005-03-27 17:30  skvidal

	* shell.py: 
	add some limited config settings in the shell. More to go.

2005-03-27 17:01  skvidal

	* yum/: config.py, constants.py: add BOOLEAN_STATES to constants,
	use it in config.py

2005-03-27 16:53  skvidal

	* yum/config.py: 
	remove pkgpolicy option - it is unused, anyway.

2005-03-27 16:22  skvidal

	* yum/__init__.py: 
	fix for a small problem in searchPackages()

2005-03-27 06:51  mjs

	* cli.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/config.py, yum/plugins.py: More
	plugin related updates:     - rearranged plugin initialisation:    
	    - YumBase.doPluginSetup() now exists and must be called to
	initialise	     plugins.	       - Yum's config and command
	line args are now parsed before plugins are	       initialised.
	This fixes the problems with the debug level being	     
	ignored for early plugin related output.	  - refactored the
	plugin config registration stuff so its handled 	   outside
	of config.py (much cleaner).	      - because yum config is
	parsed before plugin initialisation, a separate 	  
	plugin.conf is no longer required. Moved plugin settings to [main]
	of	      yum.conf.      - cleaned up YumPlugins.run() (return
	code not used anymore)	    - fixed up the levels on some plugin
	related log output

2005-03-27 04:22  skvidal

	* cli.py, shell.py: 
	modify order of args for cli.doRepoSetup() make todo list in
	shell.py

2005-03-27 04:13  skvidal

	* shell.py: 
	change semantic for repos commands in shell, add in list
	functionality:
	
	yum shell:    repos list - lists repositories and their states	 
	repos enable <repolist> - enables a list of repositories (space    
				 separated)    repos disable <repolisT> -
	disables a list of repositories (space				   
	 separated)

2005-03-27 03:46  skvidal

	* cli.py, output.py, shell.py, yummain.py, yum/__init__.py,
	yum/repos.py: 
	add 'enablerepo' and 'disablerepo' commands to yum shell.   -
	modified doRepoSetup() to take a thisrepo setup argument so we can
	setup	  one repo at a time   - modified the
	RepoStorage.populateSack() so that the repos list is checked	 if
	it is repoids or repo objects and used correctly   - We might want
	to think about a YumBase.reset() function that resets the    
	internal state of the object.
	
	- cleaned up some garbage comments and white space in yummain.py
	and cli.py

2005-03-27 02:58  mjs

	* cli.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/plugins.py: - modified doRepoSetup
	so that cli.py calls YumBase to do most of the work.	This makes
	the code cleaner (less duplication) and means the call for the	 
	reposetup plugin hook is only in one place.  - added call reposetup
	plugin hook

2005-03-27 02:31  mjs

	* cli.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/plugins.py: Moved __version__ to
	yum/__init__.py Added getYumVersion() to PluginConduit

	* rpmUtils/transaction.py: 
	remove old TransactionData class

2005-03-26 22:21  mjs

	* yum/: __init__.py, config.py, constants.py, plugins.py: Lots of
	plugin related changes:     - API versioning	 - cleaned up API
	somewhat     - hook methods now need a "_hook" suffix. This will
	allow detection of	 plugins that are trying to register hooks
	that aren't supported.	    - plugin hook method return codes are
	now ignored. Plugins should now use	   PluginYumExit exception
	if yum should terminate.      - started reposetup hook	    -
	custom option conflict detection      - renamed
	PLUG_OPT_WHERE_GLOBAL to PLUG_OPT_WHERE_MAIN

2005-03-26 13:28  skvidal

2005-03-25 10:13  skvidal

	* yum/config.py:

	lists

2005-03-25 04:47  mjs

	* yum/plugins.py: Plugins now have a general config file at
	/etc/yum/plugins.conf.	Each plugin also has a config file at

	PluginConduit to allow retrieval of plugin specific options.

2005-03-25 04:42  mjs

	* docs/yum.conf.5, yum/__init__.py, yum/config.py: The "reposdir"
	option now takes a list of directories to search for .repo files.
	The default is /etc/yum/repos.d and /etc/yum.repos.d.

2005-03-13 04:24  skvidal

	* yum/: packages.py, sqlitecache.py: 
	add a requiresList method to YumAvailablePackage to make it match

	it.

2005-03-12 17:13  skvidal

	* yum/constants.py: 
	add constants.py - generic constants so we don't have to do so many
	string comparisons for storing types of things. This isn't used
	anywhere yet.

	add an __iter__ method to the TransactionData class

2005-03-09 11:03  gijs

	left out a variable in the dbcache cleanup changes - fixed

2005-03-04 13:29  skvidal

	* yummain.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/sqlitesack.py: 
	- made excludeArches in repomd pkgsack and sqlite pkgsack.  - makes
	more sense to be in that class - sql select is a bit faster than
	iterating all the packages and comparing

2005-03-04 03:39  skvidal

	update TODOS on transactioninfo

2005-03-03 02:45  skvidal

	* yum/__init__.py: 
	pychecker found some rather dumb, and apparently infrequently
	encountered problems.

2005-03-02 17:18  mjs

	* cli.py, output.py, yum/mdcache.py, yum/repos.py,
	yum/sqlitecache.py: Enhanced callback for reporting cache update

	excluded.

2005-03-02 11:51  gijs

	* yum/: __init__.py, sqlitesack.py: Perform yum whatprovides
	queries that are not regular expressions by using database queries
	instead of iterating over all packages.

2005-03-02 09:28  gijs

	* yum/sqlitesack.py: sqlitesack should not be printing anything,
	remove 2 old debug messages.

2005-03-02 09:24  gijs

	* yum/: sqlitecache.py, sqlitesack.py: Using / as a database
	seperator for a list of files now. Cleaned up this stuff by using
	python's split and join instead of our own code.

2005-03-02 07:03  gijs

	* output.py, yum/sqlitesack.py: Fixes in Changelog handling code,
	mostly contributed by Panu Matilainen.

	GPL headers to newly added files.

2005-03-02 03:31  skvidal

	clean dbcache option for removing sqlite caches.  updated docs

	* cli.py, yum/depsolve.py: 
	file:// repos work again. By collapsing and remaking the po we lose
	localpath which is used if we have file:// repos. Whoops. :)

2005-03-01 09:08  skvidal

	* etc/Makefile: 
	patch from terje rosten for me being a dumbass

2005-03-01 07:53  mjs

	* yum/sqlitecache.py: Added missing "rpm_packager" column mapping
	to PackageToDBAdapter . This, combined with BaseEntry.__getitem__()
	behaviour (fixed) was causing packagers to be cached as None,
	causing "yum search" to fail.

2005-03-01 07:45  mjs

	* yum/mdparser.py: Entry __getitem__() no longer returns None for
	unknown values. This was hiding bugs when the entry parameters were
	being accessed with the wrong name.
	
	'pkgid' parameter now called 'pkgId' to suit database.

2005-02-27 17:34  gijs

2005-02-14 01:00  skvidal

	* callback.py, cli.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/depsolve.py,
	yum/packages.py, yum/transactioninfo.py: 
	- added in Terje's new patch for the rpm callback - setup some
	background for some items in transactioninfo.py - specifically
	storing the package object in the transaction member object.  -
	made pkgtup an attribute of every package object rather than a
	callable method.

2005-02-11 04:10  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/config.py, yum/repos.py: 
	rearranged repository configuration. Instead of repos being an
	attribute of the config class it is now split out as a base
	attribute from the YumBase object. This gives us better separation
	from the configParser format and let's us do newer things with
	resetting information in repositories

2005-02-11 02:04  skvidal

	* cli.py: 
	fix for localupdate/localinstall where it could not update b/c of

	serious measure to stop abuse, but it will catch 90% of the people
	who have enabled gpgchecking w/o importing any keys

	some_package_from_a_repo
	
	and it will 'do the right thing'
	
	However, you will pay the performance penalty of importing the
	repository metadata if you do it w/install

2004-10-15 02:48  skvidal

2004-08-30 01:35  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/depsolve.py, yum/repos.py: 
	make caching mode/user mode work again - silly caches, tricks are
	for kids!

2004-08-30 01:13  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/packages.py, rpmUtils/transaction.py: 
	update takes options now obsoletes should work better - a touch

2004-08-29 23:43  skvidal

	* cli.py, output.py, yum/config.py, yum/depsolve.py: 
	--rss-filename= to output the rss to a file default writes to

2004-08-29 19:44  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/config.py, rpmUtils/miscutils.py,
	rpmUtils/transaction.py, yum/depsolve.py, yum/repos.py: 
	- installroot now works - fix depsolving for filedeps in certain
	situations - clean up cruft in all sorts of places

2004-08-29 04:05  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/__init__.py, rpmUtils/updates.py:

	empty repository fix and clean up debug print's

2004-08-27 02:55  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/depsolve.py, yum/packages.py, rpmUtils/miscutils.py:

	* yum/__init__.py: 
	additional output/debugging strings

2004-08-23 02:58  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/config.py: 
	- make a numrecent option in the yum.conf - refine the
	functionality of yum list recent (and hence generate-rss) a bit   -
	The concept of what 'recent' means will need to be refined
	considerably	 right now it's pretty	much a sort by file
	timestamp, not much more.      it really should be something more
	related to relative age to system      date. There is much room for
	refinement and anyone wishing to undertake	that refinement is
	quite welcome to do so. :)

2004-08-23 02:41  skvidal

	* cli.py: 
	add debugging output make yum list (w/o any package narrowing

	whitespace fix in rpmUtils fix docstring in yum/packages.py

2004-08-23 01:08  skvidal

	* yum/: __init__.py, config.py: 
	- make excludes work - this might require some re-implementation as
	it currently removes the   packageobject from the pkgSack. This is
	fine, but it takes time to do this.
	
	A couple of options:  - simply make a list of excluded
	packageobjects and check that during	listing and depresolution
	(this is kinda icky b/c we end up doing lots of    checks
	throughout all of yum)	- delete the objects from the pkgsack and
	add them to an excluded sack so we    can query on them later.

2004-08-23 01:01  skvidal

	* yum/depsolve.py: 
	removed wrongly named and redundant method call

2004-08-22 16:35  skvidal

	* yum/depsolve.py: 
	removed old function stubs

2004-08-22 05:09  skvidal

	* output.py: 
	- added guid to each package item.  - more info to non-xhtml output
	- need to pass in repos object or figure another way to get   valid
	link locations for packages.

2004-08-22 03:59  rtomayko

	* output.py: Fixed a few generateRSS bugs: - ChangeLog entries
	don't have dates. Removed from format.	- Put a pre tag around
	changelog text in description. Readers that don't   understand
	xhtml:body were stripping linear whitespace.

2004-08-22 03:10  rtomayko

	* output.py: Fixed bad indent (some lines were 2 spaces)

2004-08-22 02:44  rtomayko

	* output.py: First crack at implementing generate-rss command. 
	I've been testing with:
	
	  python yummain.py -c yum.conf -d 0 generate-rss > yum.rss
	
	The generated file should be valid RSS 2.0. All required elements
	are present and there should be no chance of outputting ill-formed
	XML. Some other implementation notes of interest:
	
	  * Item title's are set to the package's n-e.v-r.a
	  * Item pubDate's are set to the package's buildtime.
	  * The content for an item is the package's summary, followed by
	    the description, followed by the changelog.
	  * The ChangeLog for a package contains only the last three
	entries.
	
	Some notes for the future:
	
	  * The entire RSS feed is being built up within a single libxml2
	    document. If we want to extend this to build arbitrarily large
	    feeds, we may need to output each item as we go instead of
	waiting
	    until the whole feed is built.
	
	  * Might be nice to add an output file argument for convienience
	(-d 0
	    and redirecting stdout is slightly annoying). Should just work.

2004-08-19 03:47  skvidal

	* callback.py, yum/repos.py: 
	fix caching code for pkg download bug in callback on erasures

2004-08-19 03:27  skvidal

	* yummain.py, yum/depsolve.py, yum/packages.py,
	rpmUtils/__init__.py: 
	still more dep resolution fixes and now erasures should be
	significantly faster

2004-08-19 02:55  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/depsolve.py: 
	more dep fixes and a rather silly process ordering problem in
	doTransaction()

	rpmUtils/transaction.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/depsolve.py,
	yum/packages.py: 
	installations work erasures work - but some of the depresolution is
	wrong.	rpm callback needs to be cleaned up for output.

2004-08-14 04:33  skvidal

	* yum/: __init__.py, depsolve.py: 
	speed up the depsolver a bit

2004-08-13 05:07  skvidal

	* cli.py, output.py, yummain.py, yum/__init__.py, yum/depsolve.py,
	yum/repos.py:

	added an addPkg() method to ListPackageSack Class

2004-08-12 03:35  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/repos.py:

	when you yum -d # - the number is what level of those logs you want
	to see.
	
	if the number is 3 then you see all logs at level 3 or lower (this
	only effects the 'log' object - errorlog and filelog ALWAYS happen)

2002-06-11 10:07  skvidal

2002-06-10 23:52  skvidal

	* clientStuff.py, config.py, yum.conf: 
	clientStuff.py: made the headerinfo nevral do pkgpolicy for last vs
	newest - default is newest. this means that the servers are loaded
	in the order they appear in the conf file. If you have
	pkgpolicy=last then the last server's pkgs if they conflict/collide
	with the others will win.
	
	pkgpolicy=newest (or nothing) will mean the newest pkgs get into
	the headerInfonevral.
	
	modifications to config.py to accomodate this yum.conf to show it.
