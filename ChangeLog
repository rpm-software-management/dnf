2004-08-30 01:35  skvidal

	make caching mode/user mode work again - silly caches, tricks are
	for kids!

2004-08-30 01:13  skvidal

	* cli.py, rpmUtils/transaction.py, yum/packages.py: 
	update takes options now obsoletes should work better - a touch

	yum-rss.xml in cwd

2004-08-29 19:44  skvidal

	* cli.py, rpmUtils/miscutils.py, rpmUtils/transaction.py,
	yum/__init__.py, yum/config.py, yum/depsolve.py, yum/repos.py:

2004-08-29 04:05  skvidal

	* cli.py, repomd/packageObject.py, repomd/packageSack.py,
	rpmUtils/updates.py, yum/__init__.py:

	additional output/debugging strings

2004-08-23 02:58  skvidal

	* cli.py, yum/config.py: 
	- make a numrecent option in the yum.conf - refine the
	functionality of yum list recent (and hence generate-rss) a bit   -
	The concept of what 'recent' means will need to be refined
	considerably	 right now it's pretty	much a sort by file
	timestamp, not much more.      it really should be something more
	related to relative age to system      date. There is much room for
	refinement and anyone wishing to undertake	that refinement is
	quite welcome to do so. :)

2004-08-23 02:41  skvidal

	* cli.py: 
	add debugging output make yum list (w/o any package narrowing

	whitespace fix in rpmUtils fix docstring in yum/packages.py

2004-08-23 01:08  skvidal

	* yum/: __init__.py, config.py: 
	- make excludes work - this might require some re-implementation as
	it currently removes the   packageobject from the pkgSack. This is
	fine, but it takes time to do this.
	
	A couple of options:  - simply make a list of excluded
	packageobjects and check that during	listing and depresolution
	(this is kinda icky b/c we end up doing lots of    checks
	throughout all of yum)	- delete the objects from the pkgsack and
	add them to an excluded sack so we    can query on them later.

2004-08-23 01:04  skvidal

	* repomd/packageSack.py: 
	- fixed exception in returnPackages() for calls to it with an
	empty/non-existent repoid - removed redundant method call

2004-08-23 01:01  skvidal

	* yum/depsolve.py: 
	removed wrongly named and redundant method call

2004-08-22 16:35  skvidal

	* yum/depsolve.py: 
	removed old function stubs

2004-08-22 05:09  skvidal

	* output.py: 
	- added guid to each package item.  - more info to non-xhtml output
	- need to pass in repos object or figure another way to get   valid
	link locations for packages.

2004-08-22 03:59  rtomayko

	* output.py: Fixed a few generateRSS bugs: - ChangeLog entries
	don't have dates. Removed from format.	- Put a pre tag around
	changelog text in description. Readers that don't   understand
	xhtml:body were stripping linear whitespace.

2004-08-22 03:10  rtomayko

	* output.py: Fixed bad indent (some lines were 2 spaces)

2004-08-22 02:44  rtomayko

	* output.py: First crack at implementing generate-rss command. 
	I've been testing with:
	
	  python yummain.py -c yum.conf -d 0 generate-rss > yum.rss
	
	The generated file should be valid RSS 2.0. All required elements
	are present and there should be no chance of outputting ill-formed
	XML. Some other implementation notes of interest:
	
	  * Item title's are set to the package's n-e.v-r.a
	  * Item pubDate's are set to the package's buildtime.
	  * The content for an item is the package's summary, followed by
	    the description, followed by the changelog.
	  * The ChangeLog for a package contains only the last three
	entries.
	
	Some notes for the future:
	
	  * The entire RSS feed is being built up within a single libxml2
	    document. If we want to extend this to build arbitrarily large
	    feeds, we may need to output each item as we go instead of
	waiting
	    until the whole feed is built.
	
	  * Might be nice to add an output file argument for convienience
	(-d 0
	    and redirecting stdout is slightly annoying). Should just work.

2004-08-19 03:47  skvidal

	* callback.py, yum/repos.py: 
	fix caching code for pkg download bug in callback on erasures

2004-08-19 03:27  skvidal

	made the transaction.TransactionWrapper support iterating over the
	rpm.ts to extract transaction elements made new YumPackage class
	which subclasses packageObject.RpmXMLPackageObject   - need a nicer
	getHeader() function and the repos.get() function needs to handle
	more of urlgrabbers handling   - the ts for depsolving is now
	populateable w/o any heavy lifting.    should sit down tonight and
	do the cli parsing f'real and populate the ts,	f'real.

	* rpmUtils/__init__.py, rpmUtils/transaction.py, yum/repos.py:

	when you yum -d # - the number is what level of those logs you want
	to see.
	
	if the number is 3 then you see all logs at level 3 or lower (this
	only effects the 'log' object - errorlog and filelog ALWAYS happen)
	
	yum -d 0 should show nothing b/c there is nothing that low.

2002-06-11 15:23  skvidal

	add a message to tell people more about what is going on.

2002-06-11 10:07  skvidal

	with the others will win.
	
	pkgpolicy=newest (or nothing) will mean the newest pkgs get into
	the headerInfonevral.
	
	modifications to config.py to accomodate this yum.conf to show it.
