Yum - an automatic updater and installer for rpm-based systems
-------------------------------------

Included programs:
/usr/sbin/yum		Main program
/usr/sbin/yum-arch	Generate the database that yum downloads

Basic usage description follows:

Yum is run with one of the following options:

 - update [package list]
	If run without any packages, Yum will automatically upgrade every
	currently installed package.  If one or more packages are
	specified, Yum will only update the packages listed.

 - install <package list>
	Yum will install the latest version of the specified package
	(don't specify version information).

 - remove <package list>
	Yum will remove the specified packages from the system.

 - yum list [package list]
        List available packages

yum-arch is run from the distribution site in order to create the
databases which Yum determines remote package availability.

yum-arch is run in one of two ways:
	yum-arch <top level of archive>




Theory of operation/use:Yum works by providing the headers of all the rpm packages in any system
repository. These headers are stored on the webserver in a subdir of the 
top level of the repository. The client downloads all of the headers of 
the packages it doesn't have installed or of packages that have been updated.
It uses the headers to determine the dependencies it will need using rpm's internal 
dependency calculation. Once it knows what rpms it will need it downloads them and
performs the transaction.
