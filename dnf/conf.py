"""
The configuration classes and routines in yum are splattered over too many
places, hard to change and debug. The new structure here will replace that. Its
goal is to:

* accept configuration options from all three sources (the main config file,
  repo config files, command line switches)
* handle all the logic of storing those and producing related values.
* returning configuration values.
* optionally: asserting no value is overridden once it has been applied
  somewhere (e.g. do not let a new repo be initialized with different global
  cache path than an already existing one).
