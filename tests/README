= DNF Testing Framework =

What will not be tested:

* all combinations of query parameters (tested in hawkey)
* rpm transactions themselves (tested in RPM)
* depsolving (the core depsolving algorithms are tested in libsolv, correctly
  setting up libsolv is hawkey's job)

== The repos/ directory ==

This directory contains sample package data for testing. The goal is to have as
few packages as possible, ideally one or two per a specific testing role they
can play.


== Notes ==

On Python2 you need the mock module installed. On Python3 the tests use
the unittest.mock module instead.
