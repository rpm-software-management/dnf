==========
 Synopsis
==========

``dnf-automatic [<config file>]``

=============
 Description
=============

Alternative CLI to ``dnf upgrade`` with specific facilities to make it suitable to be executed automatically and regularly from systemd timers, cron jobs and similar.

The operation of the tool is completely controlled by the configuration file and the command only accepts single optional argument pointing to it. If no configuration file is passed from the command line, ``/etc/dnf/automatic.conf`` is used.

The tool synchronizes package metadata as needed and then checks for updates available for the given system and then either exits, downloads the packages or downloads and applies the packages. The outcome of the operation is then reported by a selected mechanism, for instance via the standard output, email or motd messages.

A few default systemd units are provided to enable some standard configurations:

- dnf-automatic-notifyonly
- dnf-automatic-download
- dnf-automatic-install

===================
 Run dnf-automatic
===================

You can select on that most closely fits your needs, customize ``/etc/dnf/automatic.conf`` for any specific behaviors, and enable the timer unit.

For example:``systemctl enable dnf-automatic-notifyonly.timer && systemctl start dnf-automatic-notifyonly.timer``

===========================
 Configuration File Format
===========================

The configuration file is separated into topical sections.

``apply_updates``
    boolean, default: False

    Whether packages comprising the available should be applied (i.e. installed via RPM). Implies ``download_updates``. Note that if this is set to ``False``, downloaded packages will be left in the cache to the next successful DNF transaction.

``download_updates``
    boolean, default: False

    Whether packages comprising the available should be downloaded.

.. _upgrade_type_automatic-label:

``upgrade_type``
    either one of ``default``, ``security``, default: ``default``

    What kind of upgrades to look at. ``default`` signals looking for all available updates, ``security`` only those with an  issued security advisory.

``random_sleep``
    time in seconds, default: 300

    Maximal random delay before downloading.

----------------------
``[emitters]`` section

Choosing how the results should be reported.

.. _emit_via_automatic-label:

``emit_via``
    list, default: ``email, stdio, motd``

    List of emitters to report the results through. Available emitters are ``stdio`` to print the result to standard output, ``email`` to send the report via email and ``motd`` sends the result to */etc/motd* file.

``system_name``
    string, default: hostname of the given system
