========================
Repository Configuration
========================

.. class:: dnf.repodict.RepoDict

  Dictionary mapping repository IDs to the respective :class:`dnf.repo.Repo` objects. Derived from the standard :class:`dict`.

  .. method:: add(repo)

    Add a :class:`.Repo` to the repodict.

  .. method:: all()

    Return a list of all contained repositories.

    See the note at :meth:`get_matching` for special semantics of the returned object.

  .. method:: get_matching(key)

    Return a list of repositories which ID matches (possibly globbed) `key` or an empty list if no matching repository is found.

    The returned list acts as a `composite <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern>`_, transparently forwarding all method calls on itself to the contained repositories. The following thus disables all matching repos::

      repos = base.repos.get_matching('*-debuginfo')
      repos.disable()

  .. method:: iter_enabled()

    Return an iterator over all enabled repos from the dict.

.. module:: dnf.repo

.. function:: repo_id_invalid(repo_id)

  Return index of the first invalid character in the `repo_id` or ``None`` if all characters are valid. This function is used to validate the section names in ``.repo`` files.

.. class:: Metadata

  Represents the metadata files.

  .. attribute:: fresh

    Boolean. ``True`` if the metadata was loaded from the origin, ``False`` if it was loaded from the cache.

.. class:: Repo

  Repository object used for metadata download. To configure it properly one has to give it either :attr:`metalink`, :attr:`mirrorlist` or :attr:`baseurl` parameter.

  .. attribute:: baseurl

     List of URLs for this repository. Defaults to ``[]``.

  .. attribute:: id

    ID of this repo.

  .. attribute:: metadata

    If :meth:`~load` has been called and succeeded, this contains the relevant :class:`Metadata` instance.

  .. attribute:: metalink

    URL of a metalink for this repository. Defaults to ``None``

  .. attribute:: mirrorlist

    URL of a mirrorlist for this repository. Defaults to ``None``

  .. attribute:: name

    A string with the repo's name. By default it has value of repo's ID.

  .. attribute:: pkgdir

    Directory where packages of a remote repo will be downloaded to. By default it is derived from `cachedir` in :meth:`.__init__` but can be overriden by assigning to this attribute.

  .. attribute:: proxy

    URL of of a proxy server to use when connecting to this repo. Defaults to ``None``, i.e. no proxy used. Also see :attr:`.Conf.proxy`.

  .. attribute:: proxy_username

    The username to use for connecting to the proxy server. Defaults to ``None``.

  .. attribute:: proxy_password

    The password to use for connecting to the proxy server. Defaults to ``None``.

  .. attribute:: skip_if_unavailable

    If enabled, DNF will continue running and disable the repository that couldn't be contacted for any reason when downloading metadata. This option doesn't affect skipping of unavailable packages after dependency resolution. The default is ``True``.

  .. attribute:: sslcacert

    Path to the directory or file containing the certificate authorities to verify SSL certificates.
    Defaults to None - uses system default.

  .. attribute:: sslverify

    Whether SSL certificate checking should be performed at all. Defaults to ``True``.

  .. attribute:: sslclientcert

    Path to the SSL client certificate used to connect to remote sites.
    Defaults to None.

  .. attribute:: sslclientkey

    Path to the SSL client key used to connect to remote sites.
    Defaults to None.

  .. attribute:: username

    The username to use for connecting to repo with basic HTTP authentication. Defaults to ``None``.

  .. attribute:: password

    The password to use for connecting to repo with basic HTTP authentication. Defaults to ``None``.

  .. method:: __init__(id_, cachedir)

    Init repository with ID `id_` and using the `cachedir` path for storing downloaded and temporary files.

  .. method:: disable()

    Disable the repository. Repositories are enabled by default.

  .. method:: enable()

    Enable the repository (the default).

  .. method:: load()

    Load the metadata of this repository. Will try to use local cache if possible and initiate and finish download if not. Returns ``True`` if fresh metadata has been downloaded and ``False`` if cache was used. Raises :exc:`dnf.exceptions.RepoError` if the repo metadata could not be obtained.

  .. method:: set_progress_bar(progress)

    Set the download progress reporting object for this repo during :meth:`load`. `progress` must be an instance of :class:`dnf.callback.DownloadProgress`.
