  .. method:: download_size

    Total size of this Payload when transferred (e.g. over network).

.. class:: DownloadProgress

  Base class providing callbacks to receive information about an ongoing download.

  .. method:: end(payload, status, msg)

    Report finished download of a `payload`, :class:`.Payload` instance. `status` is a constant with the following meaning:

    ====================== =======================================================
    `status` value         meaning

    `msg` is an optional string error message further explaining the `status`.

  .. method:: progress(payload, done)

    Report ongoing progress on the given `payload`. `done` is the number of bytes already downloaded from `payload`.

  .. method:: start(total_files, total_size, total_drpms=0)

    Report start of a download batch. `total_files` is the total number of payloads in the batch.
    `total_size` is the total number of bytes to be downloaded. `total_drpms` is the total number
    of drpms payloads in the batch.

.. class:: TransactionProgress

  Base class providing callbacks to receive information about an ongoing transaction.

  .. method:: error(message)

    Report an error that occurred during the transaction. `message` is a string which describes the error.

  .. method:: progress(package, action, ti_done, ti_total, ts_done, ts_total)

    Report ongoing progress on the given transaction item. `package` is the :class:`dnf.package.Package` being processed and `action` is a constant with the following meaning:

    ================== ================================================================================= ===========
    `action` value     meaning                                                                           Appearance*
