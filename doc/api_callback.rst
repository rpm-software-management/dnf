  .. method:: end(payload, status, msg)

    Report finished download of a `payload`, :class:`.Payload` instance. `status` is a constant with the following meaning:

  .. method:: start(total_files, total_size)

    Report start of a download batch. `total_files` is the total number of payloads in the batch. `total_size` is the total number of bytes to be downloaded.

.. class:: TransactionProgress

  Base class providing callbacks to receive information about an ongoing transaction.

  .. method:: error(message)
