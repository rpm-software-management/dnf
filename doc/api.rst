 DNF API Reference
###################

.. contents::

==============
 Introduction
==============

The provided Python API to DNF is supposed to mainly allow writing the following two categories of programs:

1. :doc:`plugins <api_plugins>` to DNF which extend functionality of the system's DNF installation.
2. extension applications that embed DNF (by importing its Python modules) to perform specific package management tasks.

Please refer to the :doc:`use_cases` where you can find examples of API usage.

.. NOTE::

  The API consists of exactly those elements described in this document, items not documented here can change release to release. Opening a `bugzilla`_ if certain needed functionality is not exposed is the right thing to do.

============
 Versioning
============

DNF follows the Semantic Versioning as defined at http://semver.org/.

This basically means that if your piece of software depends on e.g. DNF 1.1, the requirement can be specified as ``1.1 <= dnf < 2``. In other words, you can be sure that your software will be API-compatible with any later release of DNF until the next major version is issued. The same applies for the CLI compatibility.

.. _deprecating-label:

Incompatible API changes are subject to our deprecation policy. Deprecated API items (classes, methods, etc.) are designated as such in the :doc:`release_notes`. The first release where support for such items can be dropped entirely must have, relative to the deprecating release, a higher major version number. DNF will log a warning when a deprecated item is used.
