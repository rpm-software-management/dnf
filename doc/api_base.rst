===================================
 ``Base``---The centerpiece of DNF
===================================

.. class:: dnf.Base

  Instances of :class:`dnf.Base` are the central point of functionality supplied by DNF. An application will typically create a single instance of this class which it will keep for the runtime needed to accomplish its packaging tasks. Plugins are managed by DNF and get a reference to :class:`dnf.Base` object when they run.

  :class:`.Base` instances are stateful objects holding references to various data sources and data sinks. To properly finalize and close off any handles the object may hold, client code should either call :meth:`.Base.close` when it has finished opertions with the instance, or use the instance as a context manager. After the object has left the context, or its :meth:`.Base.close` has been called explicitly, it must not be used.

  .. attribute:: comps

    Is ``None`` by default. Explicit load via :meth:`read_comps`  initializes this attribute to a :class:`dnf.comps.Comps` instance.

  .. attribute:: conf

    An instance of :class:`dnf.conf.Conf`, concentrates all the different configuration options. :meth:`__init__` initializes this to usable defaults.

  .. attribute:: repos

    A :class:`dnf.repodict.RepoDict` instance, this member object contains all the repositories available.

  .. attribute:: sack

    The :class:`Sack<dnf.sack.Sack>` that this :class:`Base<dnf.Base>` object is using. It needs to be explicitly initialized by :meth:`fill_sack`.

  .. attribute:: transaction

    A resolved transaction object, a :class:`dnf.transaction.Transaction` instance, or ``None`` if no transaction has been prepared yet.

  .. method:: __init__()

    Init an instance with a reasonable default configuration. The constructor takes no arguments.

  .. method:: add_remote_rpm(path)

    Add RPM file at `path` to the :attr:`sack` and return the respective :class:`dnf.package.Package` instance. Does the download to a temporary file if `path` is a remote URL. Raises :exc:`IOError` if there are problems obtaining or reading the file.

  .. method:: close()

    Close all external handles the object holds. This is called automatically via context manager mechanism if the instance is handled using the ``with`` statement.

  .. method:: fill_sack([load_system_repo=True, load_available_repos=True, skip_if_unavailable=False])

    Setup the package sack. If `load_system_repo` is ``True``, load information about packages in the local RPMDB into the sack. Else no package is considered installed during dependency solving. If `load_available_repos` is ``True``, load information about packages from the available repositories into the sack. When skip_if_unavailable is set to True, all repositories which metadata cannot be fetched will be skipped and disabled without raising :exc:`.RepoError`.

    This operation will call :meth:`load() <dnf.repo.Repo.load>` for repos as necessary and can take a long time. Adding repositories or changing repositories' configuration does not affect the information within the sack until :meth:`fill_sack` has been called.

    Before this method is invoked, the client application should setup any explicit configuration relevant to the operation. This will often be at least :attr:`conf.cachedir <.Conf.cachedir>` and the substitutions used in repository URLs. See :attr:`.Conf.substitutions`.

    Throws `IOError` exception in case cached metadata could not be opened.

    Example::

      base = dnf.Base()
      conf = base.conf
      conf.cachedir = CACHEDIR
      conf.substitutions['releasever'] = 22
      repo = dnf.repo.Repo('my-repo', CACHEDIR)
      repo.baseurl = [MY_REPO_URL]
      base.repos.add(repo)
      base.fill_sack()

  .. method:: do_transaction([display])

    Perform the resolved transaction. Use the optional `display` object to report the progress.

  .. method:: download_packages(pkglist, progress=None)

    Download packages in `pkglist` from remote repositories. Packages from local repositories or from the command line are not downloaded. `progress`, if given, should be a :class:`.DownloadProgress` and can be used by the caller to monitor the progress of the download. Raises :exc:`.DownloadError` if some packages failed to download.

  .. method:: group_install(group, pkg_types, exclude=None)

    Mark `group` (a :class:`dnf.comps.Group` instance) installed and mark the packages in the group for installation. Return the number of packages that the operation has marked for installation. `pkg_types` is a sequence of strings determining the kinds of packages to be installed, where the respective groups can be selected by including ``"mandatory"``, ``"default"`` or ``"optional"`` in it. If `exclude` is given, it has to be an iterable of package name glob patterns: :meth:`.group_install` will then not mark the respective packages for installation whenever possible (but e.g. packages tagged *mandatory* will be marked for installation no matter the value of `exclude`)

  .. method:: group_remove(group)

    Mark `group` (a :class:`dnf.comps.Group` instance) not installed. All the packages marked as belonging to this group will be marked for removal. Return the number of packages marked for removal in this call.

  .. method:: group_upgrade(group)

    Upgrade `group` (a :class:`dnf.comps.Group` instance). If there has been packages added to the group's comps information since installing on the system, they will be marked for installation. Similarly, removed packages get marked for removal. The remaining packages in the group are marked for an upgrade. The operation respects the package types from the original installation of the group.

  .. method:: read_all_repos()

    Read repository configuration from the main configuration file specified by :attr:`dnf.conf.Conf.config_file_path` and any ``.repo`` files under :attr:`dnf.conf.Conf.reposdir`. All the repositories found this way are added to :attr:`~.Base.repos`.

  .. method:: read_comps()

    Read comps data from all the enabled repositories and initialize the :attr:`comps` object.

  .. method:: reset(**kwargs)

    Reset the state of different :class:`.Base` attributes. Selecting attributes to reset is controlled by passing the method keyword arguments set to ``True``. When called with no arguments the method has no effect.

    =============== =================================================
    argument passed effect
    =============== =================================================
    `goal=True`     drop all the current :ref:`packaging requests <package_marking-label>`
    `repos=True`    drop the current repositries (see :attr:`.repos`). This won't
                    affect the package data already loaded into the :attr:`.sack`.
    `sack=True`     drop the current sack (see :attr:`.sack`)
    =============== =================================================

  .. method:: resolve(allow_erasing=True)

    Resolve the marked requirements and store the resulting :class:`dnf.transaction.Transaction` into :attr:`transaction`. Raise :exc:`dnf.exceptions.DepsolveError` on a depsolving error. Return ``True`` iff the resolved transaction is non-empty.

    Enabling `allow_erasing` lets to solver remove other packages while looking to fulfill the current packaging requests. For instance, this is used to allow the solver remove dependants of a package being removed.

    The exact operation of the solver further depends on the :attr:`dnf.conf.Conf.best` setting.

  .. _package_marking-label:

  The :class:`.Base` class provides a number of methods to make packaging requests that can later be resolved and turned into a transaction. The `pkg_spec` argument some of them take must be a package specification recognized by :class:`dnf.subject.Subject`. If these methods fail to find suitable packages for the operation they raise a :exc:`~dnf.exceptions.MarkingError`. Note that successful completion of these methods does not necessarily imply that the desired transaction can be carried out (e.g. for dependency reasons).

  .. method:: downgrade(pkg_spec)

    Mark packages matching `pkg_spec` for downgrade.

  .. method:: install(pkg_spec)

    Mark packages matching `pkg_spec` for installation.

  .. method:: package_downgrade(pkg)

    If `pkg` is a :class:`dnf.package.Package` in an available repository, mark the matching installed package for downgrade to `pkg`.

  .. method:: package_install(pkg)

    Mark `pkg` (a :class:`dnf.package.Package` instance) for installation. Ignores package that is already installed.

  .. method:: package_upgrade(pkg)

    If `pkg` is a :class:`dnf.package.Package` in an available repository, mark the matching installed package for upgrade to `pkg`.

  .. method:: remove(pkg_spec)

    Mark packages matching `pkg_spec` for removal.

  .. method:: upgrade(pkg_spec)

    Mark packages matching `pkg_spec` for upgrade.

  .. method:: upgrade_all

    Mark all installed packages for an upgrade.
