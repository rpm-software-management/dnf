===================================
 ``Base``---The centerpiece of DNF
===================================

.. class:: dnf.Base

  Instances of :class:`dnf.Base` are the central point of functionality supplied by DNF. An application will typically create a single instance of this class which it will keep for the runtime needed to accomplish its packaging tasks. Plugins are managed by DNF and get a reference to :class:`dnf.Base` object when they run.

  :class:`.Base` instances are stateful objects holding references to various data sources and data sinks. To properly finalize and close off any handles the object may hold, client code should either call :meth:`.Base.close` when it has finished operations with the instance, or use the instance as a context manager. After the object has left the context, or its :meth:`.Base.close` has been called explicitly, it must not be used. :meth:`.Base.close` will delete all downloaded packages upon successful transaction.

  .. attribute:: comps

    Is ``None`` by default. Explicit load via :meth:`read_comps`  initializes this attribute to a :class:`dnf.comps.Comps` instance.

  .. attribute:: conf

    An instance of :class:`dnf.conf.Conf`, concentrates all the different configuration options. :meth:`__init__` initializes this to usable defaults.

  .. attribute:: repos

    A :class:`dnf.repodict.RepoDict` instance, this member object contains all the repositories available.

  .. attribute:: sack

    The :class:`Sack<dnf.sack.Sack>` that this :class:`Base<dnf.Base>` object is using. It needs to be explicitly initialized by :meth:`fill_sack`.

  .. attribute:: transaction

    A resolved transaction object, a :class:`dnf.transaction.Transaction` instance, or ``None`` if no transaction has been prepared yet.

  .. method:: __init__()

    Init an instance with a reasonable default configuration. The constructor takes no arguments.

  .. method:: add_remote_rpms(path_list, strict=True)

    Add RPM files at list `path_list` to the :attr:`sack` and return the list of respective :class:`dnf.package.Package` instances. Does the download to a temporary files for each path if `path` is a remote URL. Raises :exc:`IOError` if there are problems obtaining during reading files and `strict=True`.

  .. method:: close()

    Close all external handles the object holds. This is called automatically via context manager mechanism if the instance is handled using the ``with`` statement.

  .. method:: init_plugins([disabled_glob=None, cli=None])

     Initialize plugins. If you want to disable some plugins pass the list of their name patterns to
     `disabled_glob`. When run from interactive script then also pass your :class:`dnf.cli.Cli` instance.

  .. method:: pre_configure_plugins()

     Configure plugins by running their pre_configure() method. It makes possible to change
     variables before repo files and rpmDB are loaded. It also makes possible to create internal
     repositories that will be affected by ``--disablerepo`` and ``--enablerepo``.

  .. method:: configure_plugins()

     Configure plugins by running their configure() method.

  .. method:: fill_sack([load_system_repo=True, load_available_repos=True])

    Setup the package sack. If `load_system_repo` is ``True``, load information about packages in the local RPMDB into the sack. Else no package is considered installed during dependency solving. If `load_available_repos` is ``True``, load information about packages from the available repositories into the sack.

    This operation will call :meth:`load() <dnf.repo.Repo.load>` for repos as necessary and can take a long time. Adding repositories or changing repositories' configuration does not affect the information within the sack until :meth:`fill_sack` has been called.

    Before this method is invoked, the client application should setup any explicit configuration relevant to the operation. This will often be at least :attr:`conf.cachedir <.Conf.cachedir>` and the substitutions used in repository URLs. See :attr:`.Conf.substitutions`.

    Throws `IOError` exception in case cached metadata could not be opened.

    Example::

      base = dnf.Base()
      conf = base.conf
      conf.cachedir = CACHEDIR
      conf.substitutions['releasever'] = 22
      base.repos.add_new_repo('my-repo', conf, baseurl=[MY_REPO_URL])
      base.fill_sack()

  .. method:: do_transaction([display])

    Perform the resolved transaction. Use the optional `display` object(s) to report the progress. `display` can be either an instance of a subclass of :class:`dnf.callback.TransactionProgress` or a sequence of such instances. Raise :exc:`dnf.exceptions.Error` or dnf.exceptions.TransactionCheckError.

  .. method:: download_packages(pkglist, progress=None)

    Download packages in `pkglist` from remote repositories. Packages from local repositories or from the command line are not downloaded. `progress`, if given, should be a :class:`.DownloadProgress` and can be used by the caller to monitor the progress of the download. Raises :exc:`.DownloadError` if some packages failed to download.

  .. method:: group_install(group_id, pkg_types, exclude=None)

    Mark group with corresponding `group_id` installed and mark the packages in the group for installation. Return the number of packages that the operation has marked for installation. `pkg_types` is a sequence of strings determining the kinds of packages to be installed, where the respective groups can be selected by including ``"mandatory"``, ``"default"`` or ``"optional"`` in it. If `exclude` is given, it has to be an iterable of package name glob patterns: :meth:`.group_install` will then not mark the respective packages for installation whenever possible.

  .. method:: group_remove(group_id)

    Mark group with corresponding `group_id` not installed. All the packages marked as belonging to this group will be marked for removal. Return the number of packages marked for removal in this call.

  .. method:: group_upgrade(group_id)

    Upgrade group with corresponding `group_id`. If there has been packages added to the group's comps information since installing on the system, they will be marked for installation. Similarly, removed packages get marked for removal. The remaining packages in the group are marked for an upgrade. The operation respects the package types from the original installation of the group.

  .. method:: read_all_repos()

    Read repository configuration from the main configuration file specified by :attr:`dnf.conf.Conf.config_file_path` and any ``.repo`` files under :attr:`dnf.conf.Conf.reposdir`. All the repositories found this way are added to :attr:`~.Base.repos`.

  .. method:: read_comps(arch_filter=False)

    Read comps data from all the enabled repositories and initialize the :attr:`comps` object. If `arch_filter` is set to ``True``, the result is limited to system basearch.

  .. method:: reset(**kwargs)

    Reset the state of different :class:`.Base` attributes. Selecting attributes to reset is controlled by passing the method keyword arguments set to ``True``. When called with no arguments the method has no effect.

    =============== =================================================
    argument passed effect
    =============== =================================================
    `goal=True`     drop all the current :ref:`packaging requests <package_marking-label>`
    `repos=True`    drop the current repositries (see :attr:`.repos`). This won't
                    affect the package data already loaded into the :attr:`.sack`.
    `sack=True`     drop the current sack (see :attr:`.sack`)
    =============== =================================================

  .. method:: resolve(allow_erasing=True)

    Resolve the marked requirements and store the resulting :class:`dnf.transaction.Transaction` into :attr:`transaction`. Raise :exc:`dnf.exceptions.DepsolveError` on a depsolving error. Return ``True`` if the resolved transaction is non-empty.

    Enabling `allow_erasing` lets the solver remove other packages while looking to fulfill the current packaging requests. For instance, this is used to allow the solver to remove dependants of a package being removed.

    The exact operation of the solver further depends on the :attr:`dnf.conf.Conf.best` setting.

  .. method:: update_cache(timer=False)

    Downloads and caches in binary format metadata for all known repos. Tries to avoid downloading whenever possible (e.g. when the local metadata hasn’t expired yet or when the metadata timestamp hasn’t changed).

    If 'timer' equals 'True', DNF becomes more resource-aware, meaning DNF will not do anything if running on battery power and will terminate immediately if it’s too soon after the last successful update_cache operation7.

  .. _package_marking-label:

  The :class:`.Base` class provides a number of methods to make packaging requests that can later be resolved and turned into a transaction. The `pkg_spec` argument some of them take must be a package specification recognized by :class:`dnf.subject.Subject`. If these methods fail to find suitable packages for the operation they raise a :exc:`~dnf.exceptions.MarkingError`. Note that successful completion of these methods does not necessarily imply that the desired transaction can be carried out (e.g. for dependency reasons).

  .. method:: downgrade(pkg_spec)

    Mark packages matching `pkg_spec` for downgrade.

  .. method:: install(pkg_spec)

    Mark packages matching `pkg_spec` for installation.

  .. method:: package_downgrade(pkg, strict=False)

    If `pkg` is a :class:`dnf.package.Package` in an available repository, mark the matching installed package for downgrade to `pkg`. If strict=False it ignores problems with dep-solving.

  .. method:: package_install(pkg)

    Mark `pkg` (a :class:`dnf.package.Package` instance) for installation. Ignores package that is already installed.

  .. method:: package_upgrade(pkg)

    If `pkg` is a :class:`dnf.package.Package` in an available repository, mark the matching installed package for upgrade to `pkg`.

  .. method:: autoremove()

    Removes all 'leaf' packages from the system that were originally installed as dependencies of user-installed packages but which are no longer required by any such package.

  .. method:: remove(pkg_spec)

    Mark packages matching `pkg_spec` for removal.

  .. method:: upgrade(pkg_spec)

    Mark packages matching `pkg_spec` for upgrade.

  .. method:: upgrade_all

    Mark all installed packages for an upgrade.

  .. method:: urlopen(url, repo=None, mode='w+b', **kwargs):

    Open the specified absolute `url` and return a file object which respects proxy setting even for non-repo downloads
