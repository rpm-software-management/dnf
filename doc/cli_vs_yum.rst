 Changes in DNF CLI compared to Yum
####################################

.. contents::

======================
 No ``--skip-broken``
======================

The ``--skip-broken`` command line switch is not recognized by DNF. The
semantics this was supposed to trigger in Yum is now the default for plain ``dnf
update``. There is no equivalent for ``yum --skip-broken update foo``, as
silentnly skipping ``foo`` in this case only amounts to masking an error
contradicting the user request. To try using the latest versions of packages in
transactions there is the ``--best`` command line switch.

========================================
Update and Upgrade Commands are the Same
========================================

Invoking ``dnf update`` or ``dnf upgrade``, in all their forms, has the same
effect in DNF, with the latter being preferred. In Yum ``yum upgrade`` was
exactly like ``yum --obsoletes update``.

================================================
 ``clean_requirements_on_remove`` on by default
================================================

The :ref:`clean_requirements_on_remove <clean_requirements_on_remove-label>`
switch is on by default in DNF. It can thus be confusing to compare the "erase"
operation results between DNF and Yum as by default DNF is often going to remove
more packages.

===========================
 No ``resolvedep`` command
===========================

The Yum version of this command is maintained for legacy reasons only. The user
can just do ``dnf provides`` to find out what package gives a particular
provide.

====================================================
 Excludes and repo excludes apply to all operations
====================================================

Yum only respects excludes during installs and upgrades. DNF extends this to all
operations, among others erasing and listing. If you e.g. want to see a list of
all installed ``python-f*`` packages but not any of the Flask packages, the
following will work::

    dnf -x '*flask*' list installed 'python-f*'

===================================
 ``protected_packages`` is ignored
===================================

DNF drops Yum's ``protected_packages`` configuration option. Generally, DNF lets
the user do what she specified, even have DNF itself removed. Similar functionality
can be implemented by a plugin.

=============================================================
 ``dnf erase kernel`` deletes all packages called ``kernel``
=============================================================

In Yum, the running kernel is spared. There is no reason to keep this in DNF,
the user can always specify concrete versions on the command line, e.g.::

    dnf erase kernel-3.9.4

=====================================================================
``dnf provides /bin/<file>`` does not find any packages on Fedora
=====================================================================

After `UsrMove <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/UsrMove>`_ there's no
directory ``/bin`` on Fedora systems and no files get installed there,
``/bin`` is only a symlink created by the ``filesystem`` package to point to
``/usr/bin``. Resolving the symlinks to their real path would only give the
user false sense that this works while in fact provides requests using globs
such as::

    dnf provides /b*/<file>

will fail still (as it does in Yum now). To find what provides a particular
binary use the actual path for binaries on Fedora::

    dnf provides /usr/bin/<file>

Also see related Fedora bugzillas `982947
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=982947>`_ and `982664
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=982664>`_.


.. _skip_if_unavailable_default:

============================================
 ``skip_if_unavailable`` enabled by default
============================================

The important system repos should never be down and we see the third party repos
down often enough to warrant this change. Note that without this setting and
without an explicit ``skip_if_unavailable=True`` in the relevant repo .ini file
Yum immediately stops on a repo error, confusing and bothering the user.

See the related `Fedora bug 984483 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=984483>`_.

============================================================================
 ``overwrite_groups`` dropped, comps functions acting as if always disabled
============================================================================

This config option has been dropped. When DNF sees several groups with the same
group id it merges the groups' contents together.

===============================
 ``mirrorlist_expire`` dropped
===============================

To simplify things for the user, DNF uses ``metadata_expire`` for both expiring
metadata and the mirrorlist file (which is a kind of metadata itself).

===========================================================
 metalink not recognized in the ``mirrorlist`` repo option
===========================================================

The following part of ``yum.conf(5)`` no longer applies for the ``mirrorlist``
option:

    As a special hack is the mirrorlist URL contains the word "metalink" then
    the value of mirrorlist is copied to metalink (if metalink is not set).

The relevant repository configuration files have been fixed to respect this, see
the related `Fedora bug 948788
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=948788>`_.

.. _group_package_types_dropped:

=================================
 ``group_package_types`` dropped
=================================

Done to simplify the configuration. User will typically want to decide what
packages to install per-group and not via a global setting.

.. _upgrade_requirements_on_install_dropped:

=============================================
 ``upgrade_requirements_on_install`` dropped
=============================================

Dropping this config option with blurry semantics simplifies the
configuration. DNF behaves as if this was disabled. If the user wanted to
upgrade everything to the latest version she'd simply use ``dnf upgrade``.

========================================
 ``dnf history rollback`` check dropped
========================================

DNF tolerates the use of other package managers. Then it is possible that not
all changes to RPMDB are stored in the history of transactions. Therefore, DNF
does not fail if such a situation is encountered and thus the ``force`` option
is not needed anymore.

.. _allowerasing_instead_of_shell:

============================================
 Packages replacement without ``yum shell``
============================================

Time after time one needs to remove an installed package and replace it with a different one, providing the same capabilities while other packages depending on these capabilities stay installed. Without (transiently) breaking consistency of the package database this can be done by performing the erase and the install in one transaction. The common way to setup such transaction in Yum is to use ``yum shell``.

There is no shell in DNF but the case above is still valid. We provide the ``--allowerasing`` switch for this purpose, e.g. say you want to replace ``A`` (providing ``P``)  with B (also providing ``P``, conflicting with ``A``) without deleting ``C`` (which requires ``P``) in the process. Use::

  dnf --allowerasing install B

============================================
 ``keepcache`` configuration option dropped
============================================

The option was used to keep the downloaded .rpm of just installed pacakges in the cache. It has been disabled in Fedora and there has been no real use cases indicated. The option has been removed in DNF which deletes all downloaded packages after a transaction completes.

Note that this option is something different than the "downloadonly" functionality in Yum.

===========================
 ``dnf history info last``
===========================

In this case, DNF recognizes ``last`` as the ID of the last transaction (like
other ``history`` subcommands), while Yum considers it a package name. It goes
similarly for ``last-N``.

========================================================
 Dependency processing details are not shown in the CLI
========================================================

During its depsolving phase, Yum outputs lines similar to::

  ---> Package rubygem-rhc.noarch 0:1.16.9-1.fc19 will be an update
  --> Processing Dependency: rubygem-net-ssh-multi >= 1.2.0 for package: rubygem-rhc-1.16.9-1.fc19.noarch

DNF does not output information like this. The technical reason is that depsolver below DNF always considers all dependnecies for update candidates and the output would be very long. Secondly, even in Yum this output gets confusing very quickly especially for large transactions and so does more harm than good.

See the the related `Fedora bug 1044999
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1044999>`_.

===================================================================
``dnf provides`` complies with the Yum documentation of the command
===================================================================

When one executes::

  yum provides sandbox

Yum applies extra heuristics to determine what the user meant by ``sandbox``, for instance it sequentially prepends entries from the ``PATH`` environment variable to it to see if it matches a file provided by some package. This is an undocumented behaivor that DNF does not emulate. Just typically use::

  dnf provides /usr/bin/sandbox

or even::

  dnf provides '*/sandbox'

to obtain similar results.

=================================
``--enableplugin`` not recognized
=================================

This switch has been dropped. It is not documented for Yum and of a questionable use (all plugins are enabled by default).

==================
Bandwidth limiting
==================

DNF supports the 'throttle' and 'bandwidth' options familiar from Yum.
Contrary to Yum, when multiple downloads run simultaneously the total
downloading speed is throttled. This was not possible in Yum since
downloaders ran in different processes.

==============================
 The usage of Delta RPM files
==============================

The boolean ``deltarpm`` option controls whether delta RPM files are used.
When on, DNF downloads delta files smaller than 50% of the RPM file and
rebuilds them using at most as many processes as the number of CPUs online.
``deltarpm_percentage`` option is not supported, and user can't fine tune
the number of delta rebuild processes used.
