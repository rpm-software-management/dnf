urlgrabber -- A high-level cross-protocol url-grabber

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

If you want to install urlgrabber on your system, simply open the package 
and run:

   python setup.py install
   
Take a look at the install options by doing

   python setup.py install --help
   
If you are on a Red Hat Linux machine that still uses python 1.5.x by
default, you may need to run python2 in place of python above.

If you just want to use urlgrabber.py (and/or keepalive.py) in your
own programs, simply grab the file(s) and put it with the rest of your
program's modules.
