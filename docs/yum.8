.PP 
Unless the \-\-help or \-h option is given, one of the above commands
must be present\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fBinstall\fP"
is used to install the latest version of a package or
group of packages while ensuring that all dependencies are
satisfied\&.  If no package matches the given package name(s), they are
assumed to be a shell glob and any matches are then installed\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBupdate\fP"
If run without any packages, \fBupdate\fP will update every currently
installed package.  If one or more packages are specified, Yum will
only update the listed packages\&.  While updating packages, \fByum\fP
will ensure that all dependencies are satisfied\&.  If no package
matches the given package name(s), they are assumed to be a shell glob
and any matches are then installed\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBcheck\-update\fP"
Implemented so you could know if your machine had any updates that needed to
be applied without running it interactively. Returns exit value of 100 if
there are packages available for an update. Also returns a list of the pkgs
to be updated in list format. Returns 0 and no packages are available for
update.
.IP
.IP "\fBupgrade\fP"
Can take packages as arguments, upgrade is just like update except that it
includes package obsoletes in its calculations - this makes it better for
distro\-version changes, for example: upgrading from somelinux 8.0 to
somelinux 9.
.IP 
.IP "\fBremove\fP"
is used to remove the specified packages from the system
as well as removing any packages which depend on the package being
removed\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBlist\fP"
can be used to list various information about available
packages; more complete details are available in the \fIList Options\fP
section below\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBprovides\fP"
can be used to find out which package provides some feature
or file. Just use a specific name or a file-glob-syntax wildcards to list
the packages available or installed that provide that feature or file\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBinfo\fP"
can be used to list a description and summary information about available
packages; takes the same arguments as in the \fIList Options\fP
section below\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBclean\fP"
is used to clean up various things which accumulate in the
yup cache directory over time.  More complete details can be found in
the \fIClean Options\fP section below\&.
.IP 
.PP 
.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"
Most command line options can be set using the configuration file as
well and the descriptions indicate the necessary configuration option
to set\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP"
Help; display a help message and then quit\&.
.IP "\fB\-y\fP"
Assume yes; assume that the answer to answer to any question which
would be asked is yes\&.
Configuration Item: \fBassume\-yes\fP
.IP "\fB\-c [config file]\fP" 
Specifies the config file location - can take http, ftp urls and local file
paths\&.
.IP "\fB\-d [number]\fP" 
Sets the debugging level to [number] \- turns up or down the amount of things that are printed\&.
.IP "\fB\-e [number]\fP" 
Sets the error level to [number] 0 \- 10. 0 means print only critical errors about which you must be told. 1 means print all errors, even ones that are not overly important. 1+ means print more errors (if any) \-e 0 is good for cron jobs.
.IP "\fB\-t\fP" 
Tells yum to be tolerant of errors on the command line with regard to packages on the commandline. For example: if you request to install foo, bar and baz and baz is installed; yum won't error out complaining that baz is already installed.
.IP "\fB\-R [time in minutes]\fP" 
Sets the maximum amount of time yum will wait before performing a command \- it randomizes over the time.
.IP "\fB\-C\fP" 
Tells yum to run entirely from cache - does not download or update any
headers unless it has to to perform the requested action.
.PP

.IP "\fByum clean oldheaders\fP"
Eliminate the old headers that yum no longer needs to determine the remote availablility of packages.

.IP "\fByum clean [all]\fP"
Runs \fByum clean packages\fP and \fByum clean oldheaders\fP as above.
