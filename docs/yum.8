.PP 
.IP "\fBinstall\fP"
is used to install the latest version of a package or
group of packages while ensuring that all dependencies are
satisfied\&.  If no package matches the given package name(s), they are
assumed to be a shell glob and any matches are then installed\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBupdate\fP"
If run without any packages, \fBupdate\fP will update every currently
installed package.  If one or more packages are specified, Yum will
only update the listed packages\&.  While updating packages, \fByum\fP
will ensure that all dependencies are satisfied\&.  If no package
matches the given package name(s), they are assumed to be a shell glob
and any matches are then installed\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBcheck-update\fP"
Implemented so you could know if your machine had any updates that needed to
be applied without running it interactively. Returns exit value of 100 if
there are packages available for an update. Also returns a list of the pkgs
to be updated in list format. Returns 0 and no packages are available for
update.
